# Sample DCC server peers
#   This file contains peers to which the local DCC server should flood
#   reports of checksums of possible spam.  See dccd(8).

# In this example the two servers, dcc1.domain.com and dcc2.domain.com
#   authenticate their floods of checksums with the passwords of the
#   passwd-ID 1000.  See the sample ids file.

# hostname,port	    rem-id [passwd-id] [out-opts] [in-opts]
#dcc1.domain.com    101	1000
#dcc2.domain.com    102	1000

# This example floods to a local server using a private IDs.  This is
#   NOT recommend.  See the description of server-ID remapping in the
#   flod file description in the dccd man page.
#temp.domain.com    32700 1000 - 32700-32767->self
#   The first "-" in that line is significant.
