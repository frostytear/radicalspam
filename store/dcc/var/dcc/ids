# Sample DCC server IDs and passwords as well as client IDs and passwords
#  See dccd(8)

# Each ID must have at least one password.  A second password can be present
#   to ease changing passwords.  Either password is always acceptable.
#   One password can be the secret currently used and the other can be the
#   previous or future secret.

# Every DCC server must have a unique server-ID.  A server ID is a number
#   between 100 and 32767.  A DCC server is a system running dccd.
# Clients use client-IDs, which are the anonymous client-ID 1 and numbers
#   starting at 32768.  DCC clients are systems that process mail and

# Server passwords or the passwords associated with server-IDs are used in
#   two areas.  First, the cdcc program uses them to authenticate its commands
#   to a server.  Passwords and IDs used for this purpose should be guarded
#   carefully. Second, passwords are used to are used to authenticate floods
#   of checksums among DCC servers.
#
# Client-IDs are used by servers to identify and authenticate clients.
#   Servers can be configured to give better service to clients not
#   using the anonymous client-ID or to give reduced or no service
#   to anonymous clients.

# It is handy to reserve a server-ID for inter-server flooding, and call it
#   a "passwd-ID."  That way the people running the DCC server on
#   dcc1.domain.com do not need to know the password that the people running
#   the dcc2.example.com server use to control that server, and vice versa.
#   If they knew each other's secret passwords, then each could control each
#   other's server with `cdcc`.
